## The Learning Process

Whenever you learn anything in software, there's this *initial barrier* to break through. You need to understand what you're learning before you can even start to learn about it. 

Sometimes this barrier is easy to break through. Sometimes it's hard. 

Often times, it's different for everyone.

### Motivation

I still remember when I was first introduced to the array.

It's a simple data structure, yet the very concept of storing data in a structure didn't 'click' for me for at least a year of learning computer science. 

Simply, my mind couldn't comprehend the fact that the computer puts these numbers in little boxes, to then be referred to later on by an index. 

In hindsight, if somebody gave me the analogy of a filing cabinet or a labelled chest of drawers, I would've understood sooner. 

The point is, the fact that I didn't understand the concept at a high level is what held me back. I needed to break through this initial understanding first.

### Purpose

The goal of this book is to provide that initial reading for a variety of topics.
